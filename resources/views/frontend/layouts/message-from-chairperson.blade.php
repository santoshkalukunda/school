                    Welcome to the official website of Sustainable Enterprise and Environment Development Working
                    Awareness Centre (SEEWAC) Nepal!

                    At SEEWAC Nepal, we are driven by a passionate team of development practitioners, gender activists,
                    and professional trainers. Since our establishment in 2063 B.S, we have been dedicated to the
                    socio-economic empowerment of marginalized communities in Sudurpaschim Province, Nepal.

                    Our focus is on creating a positive impact in the lives of children, youth, women, Dalits,
                    indigenous communities, minorities, and the socio-economically marginalized. We believe that
                    development starts with people, and our efforts are geared towards improving their overall quality
                    of life.

                    SEEWAC Nepal is committed to social justice and transformation. Our vision is to build a
                    self-sufficient, aware, and just society, and we work towards this goal every day.

                    As a woman-led organization, we prioritize the needs of women, girls, and youths, ensuring equal
                    opportunities and protection for all. Our projects and initiatives are aligned with the Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs), and we strive for environment-friendly and climate-focused development.

                    Join us in our mission to eliminate discrimination, create sustainable livelihoods, and promote
                    social prosperity. Together, we can make a real difference in the lives of those in need.

                    Thank you for visiting our website and supporting our cause. <br>

                    With warm regards,<br>
