                    Till 2003, FAYA had focused its activities primarily on facilitating youths and their networks to
                    fight
                    social evils. The evolution to Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) took place during 2004-2008 with
                    FAYA
                    joining in and taking a lead in number of district and regional human rights networks/alliances.
                    During
                    this period, FAYA facilitated public policy agenda related to equal wage for equal work, right to
                    safe
                    rehabilitation of freed Kamiya and strengthening of women’s network. Strategic partnership was
                    forged
                    with a number of peoples’ organizations and development partners.

                    The adoption of third strategic plan (2009-2013) was a major event in FAYA’s institutional
                    development.
                    The strategy plan had adopted four foundational themes – livelihood, education, health and disaster
                    risk
                    reduction and emergency response; and three cross cutting themes namely HIV and AIDS, gender
                    mainstreaming and democratization and governance. In this period, FAYA gained prominence as a
                    leading
                    right based development organization among stakeholders and partner communities. Through the fourth
                    strategic plan (2014-2018), FAYA-Nepal has been devoting its efforts towards building society
                    without
                    the poverty and injustice in which people enjoys their right to dignified life.

                    Currently FAYA is implementing its fourth strategy plan (2014-2018), with the aim to consolidate its
                    existing engagement, deepen quality of its programming and focus on its own organizational
                    development.
                    The overarching aim is to promote citizenship of the partner communities to claim and enjoy basic
                    services and promote accountable local government. The Theory of Change guides our strategic
                    thinking,
                    priorities and action plan.

                    FAYA-Nepal is devoting its efforts to fulfill its commitment through partnership with various local,
                    national as well as international agencies, networks and alliances. FAYA-Nepal believes that social
                    transformation only possible through the joint endeavor from all the concerned actors of the
                    society.
                    Considering this fact, FAYA Nepal have been focusing its intervention towards social transformation
                    by
                    leading its members with the slogan of ‘Together for Prosperity.’

                    <p>
                        Twenty Five glorious years have been passed successfully, since the establishment of FAYA Nepal
                        in
                        1995. The acknowledgement it received from the people is its earning. The learning of its past
                        is
                        contributing it to crawl toward maturity. Being a matured organization is the matter of pleasure
                        and
                        the challenge, at once. FAYA would like to move forward changing the challenge into opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the two decades since the establishment, FAYA had worked as a rights activist organization
                        and
                        contributed towards local level rights and social movements and gained prominence as a leading
                        right
                        based development organization among stakeholders and people living in poverty. Then it has
                        gradually transformed itself into a humanitarian and developmental organization. Now, it is
                        being
                        consolidated as a right based humanitarian and developmental organization. The achievement of
                        FAYA
                        is cumulative result of hard work of FAYA volunteers, staffs and its well-wishers. The
                        remarkable
                        contribution from all the donors, partners and stakeholders is always prized. I would like to
                        thank
                        to all for the together for prosperity we brought.

                        Today, when we are celebrating our silver jubilee of our beloved organization, the new democracy
                        of
                        our country is getting consolidated. Democratic consolidation needs a vibrant civil society and
                        civic engagement. It also needs prosper economic base to be flourished. As being a tool of civil
                        society, the role of CSOs has increased and diversified than ever before. A democratic
                        consolidation
                        and prosper economy can be exercised only through the conscious efforts of people. FAYA has
                        envisioned the “establishment of a prosper society” as its vision and “contributing sustainable
                        development for obtaining prosperity” as its mission. Onward, FAYA’s all new goals, objectives,
                        efforts and interventions will serve its vision and the mission.

                    <p>
                        Now, I would like to request with all FAYA supporters, partners and stakeholders for your

                    <p>
                        I am immensely happy to extend you a hearty welcome to visit us online. FAYA Nepal has crossed
                        its two decade long period of its social work. Since its establishment, in order to contribute
                        towards social transformation, FAYA Nepal has been fighting against the poverty, superstition
                        and all kinds of discrimination exist in the society. Similarly, FAYA Nepal has been striving to
                        build an equitable and just society in Mid and Far West Region of Nepal. During this period,
                        FAYA’s interventions have contributed towards building agencies of the partner communities to
                        claim basic public services, promote food security and livelihood alternates and reduce risks to
                        their lives and livelihoods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We do believe that social transformation is not possible only intervention form the single
                        person or institution instead requires the collective efforts from the actors of the society.
                        Considering this fact, FAYA Nepal has been devoting its efforts to bring changes in human lives
                        as well as in the community partnering with the government and no-government actors and leading
                        to its member with its strategic slogan <i>"Together for Prosperity"</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On behalf of FAYA Nepal and personally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and
                        gratitude to all those who have extended their support and solidarity to us since past 20 years
                        long period of FAYA Nepal’s existence. Through our collective efforts, we have been able to
                        achieve significant changes in the different section of the society. We look forward the same
                        support, collaboration and solidarity in the days to come.
