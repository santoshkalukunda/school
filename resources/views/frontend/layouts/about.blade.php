                            professional trainers. Founded in 2063, SEEWAC/Nepal is dedicated to the cause of socio-
                            economic empowerment of the children, young and adolescents, women, dalit,

                            indigenous communities, minorities, disadvantaged, excluded and socio-economically
                            marginalized communities. SEEWAC/Nepal believes that development starts with people;
                            hence is focused on the improvement in the overall quality of their lives. It focuses on the
                            poor and marginalized people and endeavours to support the communities through the
                            provision of sustainable livelihood assets and by resilient building, reducing vulnerability
                            and empowering for the realisation of universal human rights. Besides this,
                            SEEWAC/Nepal is focused on health related activities, institutional development of the
                            different self-help groups and development organization, infrastructure development and
                            addresses other contemporary development issues.
                            Sudurpaschim Province is the least development province compared to other part of the
                            country. The current major problem of the Sudurpaschim is mass poverty, gender
                            disparity and cast discrimination, lack of health facilities, illiteracy, unemployment, high
                            levels of male migration to India. Lack of basic infrastructures and present political
                            instability is also in more severe than other development region of the country. So,
                            SEEWAC/Nepal focuses to the poor and marginalized people residing in the rural areas of
                            the far and mid western region of the country.

                            mobilization. Moreover, the organization is committed to create social justice and social

                            people of the country.
                            The organization is working with primary focus on Micro Enterprise Creation and
                            Development and overall development of the country acting as a helping hand of the
